{"name":"Pinnerspace","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to PinnerSpace Page\r\n\r\nOur project aims to create a virtual pinboard, as a means for people to keep notes, both in group and personal contexts. There are apps that currently do this, but (to us) they are unsatisfactory in some areas: Whatsapp may allow for group discussions, but information comes and goes quickly, and it is difficult to locate bits of information; most note-taking programs don’t allow group usage, and usually opt for an interface that we find either too narrow (show one note at a time) or too unnatural (super-organised Pinterest style). With our project, we want to create a place to store shared information; one that grants the users freedom to design, decorate and organise their boards as they would a physical pinboard. The design should allow a “big picture view” while allowing users to keep track of specific bits of information, which should ideally help with organising their own notes in the personal context and with organising bigger events such as holiday trips in group contexts.\r\n\r\n### List of Features\r\nTo be listed.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@yzxj and @yaoxiangg\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNot yet.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
